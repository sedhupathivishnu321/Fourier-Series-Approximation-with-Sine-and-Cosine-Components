# Fourier-Series-Approximation-with-Sine-and-Cosine-Components
The Fourier Series Approximation with Sine and Cosine Components demonstrates how complex periodic signals can be constructed by summing multiple sine and cosine waves of varying frequencies and amplitudes.


Objective :

Signal Decomposition: Illustrate how any periodic function can be decomposed into a sum of sine and cosine functions with distinct frequencies, phases, and amplitudes, which form the building blocks of complex waveforms.
Frequency Representation: Demonstrate the concept of a signal's frequency spectrum, showing that complex signals can be represented as a series of frequency components (harmonics) that add up to form the original signal.
Visualization of Signal Reconstruction: Help visualize the process of reconstructing a complex signal by incrementally adding sine and cosine terms, allowing for an understanding of convergence in Fourier series approximations.
